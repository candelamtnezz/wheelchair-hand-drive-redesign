# Redesign of a Mechanical System for Manual Wheelchair Propulsion

This repository contains the documentation and resources from my Bachelor’s Thesis project at the **Universidad de Oviedo – Escuela Politécnica de Ingeniería de Gijón (May 2025)**. The project focuses on redesigning the **Kate Reed Hand Drive mechanism** to improve efficiency, ergonomics, and accessibility in manual wheelchair propulsion.

## 📖 Abstract
Traditional wheelchair propulsion systems often cause fatigue and joint strain. This project introduces an improved lever-driven propulsion mechanism with a planetary gear system, redesigned components in durable materials (nylon/metal), and ergonomic optimizations. Prototyping and real-world testing with users demonstrated reduced joint stress, smoother propulsion, and improved mechanical reliability.
