# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation and Scope
The primary objective is to enhance the functionality and performance of the Kate Reed Hand Drive wheelchair propulsion system. Current systems are inefficient in torque transfer and cause user fatigue.  
This project proposes a mechanical redesign with a planetary gear system to improve propulsion efficiency and user comfort.

## 1.2 State of the Art
There are three main types of wheelchairs: manual, assisted, and innovative designs. Lever-based systems and gear mechanisms have been explored but are often costly and lack accessibility. This project builds on that foundation to provide an economical solution.

## 1.3 Project Background
The project builds upon Kate Reedâ€™s open-source Hand Drive, which pioneered a low-cost, lever-driven wheelchair attachment.  
My work expands on this design by addressing mechanical insufficiencies and adapting it for broader usability.

## 1.4 Study of the Original Parts
The original device includes two subassemblies: the geared subassembly and the bar holder subassembly. These consist of:
- Stacked gear, spider gear, planet gear, and sun gear.
- Bar holder, ratchet, and base.
- Supporting hardware (bearings, bolts, springs).
- Other comfort elements like grips and brake cables.

## 1.5 Identification of Issues
Testing of the original design revealed:
- Mechanical insufficiency in propulsion efficiency.
- Limited adaptability to different wheel geometries.
- PLA components fracturing under stress.
- Poor structural integrity due to displaced bearings.
- Unreliable force transmission between lever and planetary system.
