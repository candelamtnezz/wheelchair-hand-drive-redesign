# 3. Final Design

## 3.1 Final Part Design
Optimized CAD models were produced in Inventor Pro, with accessible parametric features for easy iteration.

## 3.2 Standardized Components
Commercial bolts, bearings, and brake cables were integrated to reduce custom part count.

## 3.3 Assembly Instructions
