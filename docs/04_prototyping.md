# 4. Prototyping

## 4.1 Additive Manufacturing
PLA prototypes validated geometry but failed under stress.

## 4.2 Machining Process
- **Gear face milling** → steel gears.  
- **Turning of axles** → stronger shafts.  
- **Detail milling** → ratchet components.

## 4.3 Nylon Prototyping
Nylon gears produced better friction resistance and strength.

## 4.4 Final Prototype
Combined nylon + metal parts with ergonomic lever system.  
Tested successfully with user and physiotherapist.
