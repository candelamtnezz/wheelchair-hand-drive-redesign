# 2. Concept Design

## 2.1 Implementation of Mechanical Improvement
To address inefficiencies, the planetary gear system was redesigned with:
- Increased modulus (from 1 to 1.5).
- A new shaft to fit wheelchair geometry.
- Metallic gears replacing PLA for durability.

### 2.1.1 Torque Analysis
Torque was compared between manual rim propulsion (6.9 Nm) and lever propulsion (12.3 Nm), showing significant mechanical advantage.

### 2.1.2 New Shaft Design
- **Original shaft**: 12 mm, carbon steel, handled up to 100 kg load.  
- **New shaft**: Redesigned to prevent rotation of the sun gear and support higher torque.

### 2.1.3 Assembly Relations
The redesigned spider gear, sun gear, and stacked gear were integrated into a compact planetary system attached to the wheel.

### 2.1.4 Analysis of Mechanical Advantage
Epicyclic gear trains were analyzed with different gear ratios. Final configuration:  
- Sun gear: 40 teeth  
- Planet gears: 15 teeth  
- Annular gear: 70 teeth  

This yielded a torque transmission ratio of ~1.6, improving propulsion efficiency.

## 2.2 Creation of a System for Geometry Adaptation
Since wheel geometries vary, Grasshopper was used to parameterize the design for adaptability. Wheel hubs, spokes, and keyways were adjusted to fit multiple configurations.

## 2.3 Redesign of PLA Parts in Stronger Materials
PLA gears wore down quickly. Substitution with **nylon** and **metallic gears** provided higher durability and smoother operation.

---

## 2.4 New Dimensions for Structural Integrity
Fit and fastening systems were revised, including better spoke attachments and support for higher loads.

## 2.5 Revisited Lever System
Several lever designs were explored:
- Removable  
- Telescopic  
- Folding  
- Semi-fixed  
- With counterweights for balance.
