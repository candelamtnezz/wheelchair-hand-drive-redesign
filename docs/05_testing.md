# 5. Tests of Operation and Proposals for Improvement

## 5.1 Methodology
User trials conducted with a paraplegic patient and physiotherapist. Evaluated propulsion ease, comfort, and durability.

## 5.2 Results
- Smoother propulsion.  
- Reduced joint stress.  
- Intuitive and ergonomic operation.  

## 5.3 Proposals for Improvement
- **Modularity** → adjustable lever systems.  
- **Accessibility** → easier brake controls.  
- **Braking/cables** → reinforced.  
- **Bearings** → stronger fixation.  

## 5.4 Future Implementations
- Integration of **electromagnetic assist**.  
- Improved posture-support features.
